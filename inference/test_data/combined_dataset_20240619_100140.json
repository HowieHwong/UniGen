To find the diagonal, use the Pythagorean theorem where the diagonal (d) is related to the length (l) and width (w) by the equation d^2 = l^2 + w^2. First, find the garden's length and width using the information about the perimeter. Recall that the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w. Once you have the length and width, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal. Give your final answer for the diagonal rounded to two decimal places.",
